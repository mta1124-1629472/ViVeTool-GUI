| **Theme Support** | Light/Dark/System | Windows Default |
| **Accent Color Integration** | ✅ | ❌ |

### Migration Path

If you're currently using the **Legacy WinForms version**, see [MIGRATION_NOTES.md](https://github.com/mta1124-1629472/ViVeTool-GUI/blob/master/MIGRATION_NOTES.md) for detailed migration instructions to the new WPF version.

## Feature Feed System

ViVeTool GUI uses a GitHub-hosted feature feed to provide current feature lists for supported Windows builds.

### Feed Architecture

- **latest.json** - Metadata about available builds and latest build numbers
- **features/{build}/features.csv** or **features.json** - Per-build feature lists

### Feature Feed Usage

The application automatically fetches feature lists from the feed with:
- **Smart Caching** - Minimizes bandwidth usage
- **Offline Fallback** - Uses cached data when network is unavailable
- **Legacy Support** - Falls back to mach2 format for older builds

### Feature Scanner & Publishing

**For Power Users & Maintainers:**

1. Launch the Feature Scanner from the main application
2. Run a complete scan of your Windows build
3. Click **"Publish via GitHub Actions"** in the publish panel
4. Provide your build number, select format (CSV/JSON), and authenticate
5. Your feature list is automatically committed to the repository

**Note:** Publishing requires maintainer permissions. Contact repository maintainers if you encounter 403 errors.
