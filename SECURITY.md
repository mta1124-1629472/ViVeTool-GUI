Reporting vulnerabilities

- Do NOT include exploit or detailed vulnerability information in public issues. Public issues may be monitored and can expose sensitive information.
  1. Create a private GitHub Security Advisory (recommended for repository owners).

  2. Use GitHub Security Advisories for private reports (recommended). No direct email is provided; do not post vulnerability details in public issues.

- A short summary of the issue and affected components.
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions (minimal and safe).
- Proof of concept or log output (only when necessary).
- Affected versions and environment.

Response expectations

- Acknowledgement within 48 hours of receipt.
- Initial triage and next steps within 7 days where possible.
- Patch or mitigation timeline depends on severity and available resources.

Confidentiality

- We will coordinate disclosure timing with the reporter. Do not disclose details publicly until a fix or mitigation is available.

Contact

- Replace `security@vivetool-gui.example` with the appropriate project contact email or use GitHub's advisory flow.

Security report email template

- See `.github/SECURITY_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` for a ready-to-send email format.
